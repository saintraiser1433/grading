# ✅ Updated Faculty Assignment Interface

## Problem Fixed:
The page was showing **all teacher assignments** at once, but you wanted to see **only the selected teacher's assignments** when you click "Assign Subject".

## New Behavior:

### 🔄 **Before (Old Behavior):**
- Page loaded showing all teacher assignments
- No teacher selection required
- Cluttered interface with all assignments visible

### ✅ **After (New Behavior):**
- **Step 1**: Page loads with teacher selection dropdown
- **Step 2**: Select a teacher from dropdown
- **Step 3**: View only that teacher's assignments
- **Step 4**: Manage assignments for selected teacher only
