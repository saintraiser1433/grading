# ðŸ”§ Navigation Active State Fix

## Issue

When clicking on other navigation tabs (Faculty, Subjects, etc.), the Dashboard tab remained highlighted/active.

## Root Cause

The active state logic was checking if the pathname **starts with** the navigation item's href:

```typescript
const isActive = pathname === item.href || pathname.startsWith(item.href + "/")
```

**Problem:**
- Dashboard href: `/admin`
- Faculty href: `/admin/faculty`
- When on Faculty page: `/admin/faculty`.startsWith(`/admin/`) â†’ âœ… TRUE
- This made Dashboard always appear active on all admin pages!

Same issue for Teacher (`/teacher`) and Student (`/student`) dashboards.

## Solution

Added special logic to check dashboard routes **exactly** while allowing other routes to match with `startsWith`:

```typescript
// For dashboard pages, only match exact path
// For other pages, match if pathname starts with the href
const isDashboard = item.href === "/admin" || item.href === "/teacher" || item.href === "/student"
const isActive = isDashboard 
  ? pathname === item.href 
  : pathname === item.href || pathname.startsWith(item.href + "/")
```

## Changes Made

**File:** `components/dashboard-layout.tsx`

1. **Sidebar Navigation (lines 120-144)**
   - Updated active state logic to handle dashboard routes specially
   - Dashboard only active when on exact path
   - Other routes active when on page or sub-pages

2. **Header Title (lines 204-209)**
   - Updated title matching logic to use same pattern
   - Ensures header shows correct page name

## Testing

Now when you:
- âœ… Click "Dashboard" â†’ Dashboard is active, others inactive
- âœ… Click "Faculty" â†’ Faculty is active, Dashboard inactive
- âœ… Click "Subjects" â†’ Subjects is active, others inactive
- âœ… Click "School Years" â†’ School Years is active, others inactive
- âœ… Navigate to sub-pages like `/admin/faculty/new` â†’ Faculty remains active

## Behavior

### Admin Navigation
- `/admin` â†’ Dashboard active
- `/admin/faculty` â†’ Faculty active
- `/admin/faculty/new` â†’ Faculty active
- `/admin/subjects` â†’ Subjects active
- `/admin/school-years` â†’ School Years active
- `/admin/submissions` â†’ Grade Submissions active

### Teacher Navigation
- `/teacher` â†’ Dashboard active
- `/teacher/classes` â†’ My Classes active
- `/teacher/classes/123` â†’ My Classes active
- `/teacher/classes/new` â†’ My Classes active
- `/teacher/submissions` â†’ Grade Submissions active

### Student Navigation
- `/student` â†’ Dashboard active
- `/student/enroll` â†’ Enroll Subjects active
- `/student/grades` â†’ My Grades active

**Navigation active states now work correctly! âœ…**
