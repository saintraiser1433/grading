## Database Migration:

The system now requires a database migration to add the new fields:

```sql
-- Add assignedTeacherId to Subject table
ALTER TABLE "Subject" ADD COLUMN "assignedTeacherId" TEXT;

-- Add foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE "Subject" ADD CONSTRAINT "Subject_assignedTeacherId_fkey" 
FOREIGN KEY ("assignedTeacherId") REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX "Subject_assignedTeacherId_idx" ON "Subject"("assignedTeacherId");
```

**The teacher workflow has been successfully updated! Teachers can now only create classes for subjects assigned to them by the admin.** 🎉
