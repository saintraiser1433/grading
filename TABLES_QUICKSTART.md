# 🚀 Quick Start - Tables with Pagination, Search & Sorting

## ✅ What Was Done

All tables in your GIT Grading System now have:
- 📄 **Pagination** (10/20/30/40/50 rows per page)
- 🔍 **Search** with real-time filtering
- ↕️ **Sorting** on column headers
- 👁️ **Column visibility** toggle
- 🎯 **Action menus** with dropdowns
- 🌙 **Dark mode** support

---

## 📦 Installation

The only new dependency is `@tanstack/react-table`:

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-table
```

**Note**: If you encounter the Prisma permission error on Windows (like before), just close VS Code, delete `node_modules\.prisma`, and try again. Or skip it - the package might already be installed based on your package-lock.json.

## 🎯 Updated Tables

### Admin Module
1. ✅ **Faculty** (`/admin/faculty`) - Search by name, sort by any column
2. ✅ **Subjects** (`/admin/subjects`) - Search by code/name, toggle open/closed
3. ✅ **School Years** (`/admin/school-years`) - Search by year, set active
4. ✅ **Grade Submissions** (`/admin/submissions`) - Search by subject/teacher, approve/decline

### Teacher Module
5. ✅ **Class Students** (in class detail) - Search by name/ID, remove students
6. ✅ **My Submissions** (`/teacher/submissions`) - View submission history

### Student Module
7. ✅ **My Grades** (`/student/grades`) - View all grades with search/sort

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If search doesn't work:
- Check that `searchKey` prop matches a column's `accessorKey`
- For computed columns (like full name), add a custom `filterFn`

### If sorting doesn't work:
- Ensure the column has `accessorKey` defined
- Check that data types are correct (strings, numbers, dates)

### If pagination is slow:
- Reduce the initial `pageSize` (default is 10)
- Check data size - tables work best with < 10,000 rows

### If styling looks off:
- Ensure Tailwind classes are available
- Check dark mode CSS variables in `app/globals.css`
- Verify ShadCN components are properly installed

## 🎓 How to Add a New Table

Want to add pagination/search/sort to another table?

```tsx
// 1. Import the components
import { DataTable, DataTableColumnHeader } from "@/components/ui/data-table"
import { ColumnDef } from "@tanstack/react-table"

// 2. Define columns
const columns: ColumnDef<YourType>[] = [
  {
    accessorKey: "name",
    header: ({ column }) => (
      <DataTableColumnHeader column={column} title="Name" />
    ),
  },
  // ... more columns
]

// 3. Use the DataTable
<DataTable
  columns={columns}
  data={yourData}
  searchKey="name"
  searchPlaceholder="Search by name..."
/>
```
