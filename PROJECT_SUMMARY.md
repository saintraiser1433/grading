## 🎓 Grading System Logic

### **How Grades Are Calculated:**

1. **Teacher Sets Criteria**
   - Example: Quizzes (40%), Class Standing (20%), Exam (40%)

2. **Teacher Enters Scores**
   - Student gets 45/50 on quiz
   - Percentage: (45/50) × 100 = 90%

3. **System Calculates Weighted Score**
   - Weighted: 90% × 40% = 36 points

4. **Total Grade**
   - Sum all weighted scores = Total Grade
   - Example: 36 + 18 + 38 = 92%

5. **Pass/Fail**
   - ≥75% = PASSED (1.0 WE)
   - <75% = FAILED (0.0 WE)

6. **Final Grade**
   - Average of midterm and final
   - (Midterm + Final) / 2

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Step 1: Create .env file**
Create a file named `.env` in the root directory:

\`\`\`env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/ggs_db?schema=public"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="ggs-secret-key-change-in-production-123456"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
\`\`\`

### **Step 2: Setup Database**
\`\`\`bash
# Create database
createdb ggs_db

# Push schema
npm run db:push

# Seed demo data
npm run db:seed
\`\`\`

### **Step 3: Run Application**
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

### **Step 4: Login**
Visit http://localhost:3000

- **Admin:** admin@git.edu / admin123
